### My First Game with SpriteKit

Space Shooter is an exciting arcade game where players select their spaceship and compete to achieve the highest score. This project represents my initial experience in game development, leveraging SpriteKit and the latest macOS and iOS technologies.

Developed at the Apple Developer Academy, Space Shooter demonstrates my ability to apply modern frameworks and development best practices. The process has been both challenging and rewarding, providing a strong foundation for future projects in interactive media and game design.
